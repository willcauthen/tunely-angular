# tunely-angular lab

Full CRUD SPA with MEAN. Refactor of tunely by adding Angular.

Prerequisites:

* Express server, static assets
  * serving JSON on /api routes
* RESTful design
* Bootstrap
* CRUD with mongoose


Other tools
* bower is used, but students need not interact with it
  * components are automatically installed via an npm postinstall script


## Overview

This lab begins with no front-end and a fully built out Express/Mongoose back-end. As we progress through we'll:

* get the data from the server using `$http` and display it on the page
* add functionality to create a new album
* add functionality to remove/delete an album
* add the ability to edit/update an album
* add a route for viewing details of an album
* add functionality to CRUD songs (embedded in albums)
